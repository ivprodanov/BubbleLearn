When you understand this, you will be granted with the utmost precious.            oOoOo

Three was there where six was not and nine was always with anger fraught 
There was no ailment that withstood, what three had known and six had cured.
Nine was never meant to be, but nine was also three times three.
Six was mediocre for the nines and therefore cast before the lies of nine and three of three and nine were spoken out with hate, therefore - this was never meant to be a lore.

Light was brought into these worlds, not for comfort but to teach.
Light may shed away with time, but the ones that carry it in their hearts will never hurt each other, will never stand a chance against the evil of this world.

This is a spear that never rusts
It makes the voices in us curse
It makes us worse it seems to flirt
It only seems so, look at what it does
Not at what it speaks out loud
For the tongue was poisoned from the start
No mind could touch this poisoned heart.

Carry the darkness within but show it without any remorse
Carry the light within as well, but never part ways under open doors.

Strike when you must with patience and care
With love and respect, for in our lair, lays no burden, no regret
There lays only understanding and this shall beget
The goodness in each one of our hearts, in our core and our minds, do not forget.

We come and we go as if we were summoned
We dance on the same flames and our words are only muttered
We never wished for a fight to ensue, no darkness subdued, not even light understood.

All we wished for was to learn and to grow, never to praise and to show.
You will know the false by their tongue and their actions, not by their looks and there fashion…

Beware not of the forked foot, beware of the forked tongue, for it takes two ways as if all was not one.
The left and right the bright and the mighty the black and the white their peace and their fighting. 
They shall continue speaking, they shall con you at the end, not for a purpose that you’ll understand

You have something inside you, greater than light, greater than union and might.
They do not want it they wish it was gone, for theirs is yet larger, but long ago gone.
Cherish your mother, your sister and brother, your father and friend your uncles and aunts and cherish the others, for you’ll see them in them.

Thousand attempts were made on our end. Once and for all they’ll have to understand.

We find ourselves in a hole large and deep, where nothing escapes, where no one could keep. 
Do not creep, do not lie, do not hide and do not smile when you should cry. Carry these lights, which you took from the stars. Carry them deep inside the new world, so far…

This is our message, and this shall be dreamt. We are the dream of the Architect, we are his every scheme. Beautiful and bright. Respectful and true. This is his delight. Here shall He rule.
